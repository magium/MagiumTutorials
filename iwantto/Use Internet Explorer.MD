# I Want To Use Internet Explorer

So do we.  But there is a problem in the way IE works in regards to Xpath.  Apparently IE does not have a native Xpath handler and so Selenium Server uses a JavaScript library to do the Xpath.  However, there are a number of problems we have run into and, for the time being, there are other more important considerations.

We intend to support Internet Explorer, but not quite yet.
