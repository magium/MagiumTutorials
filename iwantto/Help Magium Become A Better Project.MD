# I Want To Help Magium Become A Better Project

There are a few ways you can help out.

1. Contribute (of course)
2. Create your own modules
3. Hire use to create libraries that integrate with Magium (keep them or donate them afterwards, your choice)
4. Use some of the third party services that will be coming down the pike.
5. Contribute.  Seriously.  Start by [saying what you would like Magium to do](Have A New Feature Created.MD).
